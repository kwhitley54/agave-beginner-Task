# Launching a Job

The Jobs service is basic execution service that allows you to run applications registered with the Apps services across multiple, distributed, heterogeneous systems through a common REST interface. The service manages all aspects of execution and job submission, monitoring, output archiving, event logging, sharing, and notifications.

Jobs contains both the details of the processing to carry out(name and versions of applications, input and output) and directive for the computer resources needed.

Running a job involves:

* Number of CPUs
